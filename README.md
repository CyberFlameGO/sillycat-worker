# Silly Cat - Cloudflare Worker

## How to use

### Custom color

Let's say you have two HEX codes, `#f32df3` and `#36da37`. You can get these from anywhere, usually googling "{color} hex code" works. If you want to use them in a silly cat, you'll:
- Remove the `#`s
  - You now have something that resembles `f32df3` and `36da37`
- Add them in the following link: https://sillycat.botato.workers.dev?color1=`FIRST_COLOR`&color2=`SECOND_COLOR`
  - `FIRST_COLOR` being `f32df3` and `SECOND_COLOR` being `36da37`
- Navigate to the link: https://sillycat.botato.workers.dev?color1=f32df3&color2=36da37
